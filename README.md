### dc-GAN
Deep Convolutional GAN adapted with NTU-RGB+D as input

#### Train
```
python dcgan-graph.py --data_path path_train_data --label_path path_train_labels
```

#
### cGAN
Conditional-GAN adapted with NTU-RGB+D as input

#### Train
```
python cgan_graph.py --data_path path_train_data --label_path path_train_labels
```

#
### StarGAN
StarGAN adapted with NTU-RGB+D as input

#### Train
```
python stargan_graph.py --train_path path_train_data --train_label_path path_train_labels --val_path path_val_data --val_label_path path_val_labels
```


#
### Graph-Autoencoder
Graph-Autoencoder adapted with NTU-RGB+D as input

#### Train
```
python graph-ae.py      # Train
python graph-ae-eval.py # Evaluate
```

### Visualization
Visualization of synthetic samples. Check [NTU-RGB+D](http://rose1.ntu.edu.sg/datasets/actionrecognition.asp) dataset labels (index=label-1).
Generator synthesizes 60 samples from the 60 classes. Classes are repeated at every 60 samples, check "jump up" example below.

```
python visualization/synthetic.py --path path_samples --index_sample 26 86 146 # Multiple samples indexes read as a list
```
